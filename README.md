[Cogment](https://cogment.ai) is an innovative open source AI platform designed to leverage the advent of AI to benefit humankind through human-AI collaboration developed by [AI Redefined](https://ai-r.com). Cogment enables AI researchers and engineers to build, train and operate AI agents in simulated or real environments shared with humans. For the full user documentation visit <https://docs.cogment.ai>

ðŸš§ This repository is under construction, it propose a library of environments and agent implementations to get started with Human In the Loop Learning (HILL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Cogment in minutes. Cogment Verse is designed both for practionners discovering the field as well as for experienced researchers or engineers as an framework to develop and benchmark new approaches.

Cogment verse includes environments from:

- [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com),
- [Petting Zoo](https://www.pettingzoo.ml).
- [MinAtar](https://github.com/kenjyoung/MinAtar).

## Getting started

### Setup, Build and Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install `parallel`, on ubuntu it is installable using `apt-get install parallel`, on mac it is available through `brew install parallel`
3. `./run.sh build`
4. `./run.sh services_start`
5. In a different terminal, start the trials with `./run.sh client start <run-name>`.
   Different run names can be found in `run_params.yaml`
6. (Optional) To launch webclient, run `./run.sh web_client_start` in a different
   terminal. Open http://localhost:8000 to join or visualize trials

#### Run monitoring

You can monitor ongoing run using [mlflow](https://mlflow.org). By default a local instance of mlflow is started by cogment-verse and is accessible at <http://localhost:3000>.

#### Human player

Some of the availabe run involve a human player,
for example `benchmark_lander_hill` enables a human player
to momentarily take control of the lunar lander to help the
AI agents during the training process.

Then start the run

```console
./run.sh client start benchmark_lander_hill
```

Access the playing interface by launching a webclient with
`./run.sh web_client_start` and navigating to <http://localhost:8000>

#### The **Play** run

The **`play`** is a run that is used to test any agent in an environment. The run is started by

```console
./run.sh client start play
```

It can be configured with the following parameters (to change in `run_params.yaml`):

```yaml
play:
  implementation: play
  config:
    class_name: data_pb2.PlayRunConfig
    # Set to true to have the ability to observe the run in the web client
    observer: true
    # Number of trials to run
    trial_count: 10
    environment:
      # Reference one of the environment specs defined at the top of `run_params.yaml`
      specs: *cartpole_specs
    actors:
    # Configure the players (only the first ones are used, up to the number of required players)
    ## follows the `cogment_verse.ActorParams` datastructure
    - name: agent_1
      actor_class: agent
      # Select the implementation to use
      implementation: random
      agent_config:
        # Define the agent config here
        ## follows the `cogment_verse.AgentConfig` datastructure
        ## Make sure that the selected model is compatible with the selected implementation
        model_id: compassionate_aryabhata_model
        model_version: -1
    - name: agent_2
      actor_class: agent
      implementation: random
```
