[Cogment](https://cogment.ai) is an innovative open source AI platform designed to leverage the advent of AI to benefit humankind through human-AI collaboration developed by [AI Redefined](https://ai-r.com). Cogment enables AI researchers and engineers to build, train and operate AI agents in simulated or real environments shared with humans. For the full user documentation visit <https://docs.cogment.ai>

🚧 This repository is under construction, it propose a library of environments and agent implementations to get started with Human In the Loop Learning (HILL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Cogment in minutes. Cogment Verse is designed both for practionners discovering the field as well as for experienced researchers or engineers as an framework to develop and benchmark new approaches.

Cogment verse includes environments from:

- [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com),
- [Petting Zoo](https://www.pettingzoo.ml).
- [MinAtar](https://github.com/kenjyoung/MinAtar).

## Getting started

### Setup

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#download-and-install)
2. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) (⚠️ you'll need version > 1.29.2 for this project)
3. Install [cogment](https://docs.cogment.ai/introduction/installation/) (⚠️ version >= 2.0.0 is required)
4. Clone this repository

### Copy the shared definitions

After a fresh close or whenever either the `cogment.yaml` or any protobuf file in the root directory is changed, you need to copy those changes to the different services source directories. This is achieved with the following.

```console
cogment run copy
```

### Start development _auto-reload_ mode

Cogment verse can be started in development mode where the services restart whenever a source is edited without needing to restart the docker images. It can be started with the following

```console
cogment run dev
```

> 🚧 In this mode, changes to the source files in the shared `base_dev` directory won't be reflected in the running services until you re-start `cogment run dev`.

To be able to use the client properly, you'll need to build it whenever something changes using

```console
cogment run build_client
```

#### Troubleshooting

This project is using rather large libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch, because of that the build might fail if docker doesn't have access to sufficient memory.

### Build production images

```console
cogment run build
```

#### Build the GPU versions

```console
cogment run build_gpu
```

### Start the production images

```console
cogment run start
```

#### Start the GPU versions

```console
cogment run start_gpu
```

### Start and stop runs

Once the services are running in either production or development mode, you can launch a _run_ with the following command

```console
RUN_PARAMS=cartpole_dqn cogment run start_run
```

The available `RUN_PARAMS` are defined in `run_params.yaml`. You can add new parameters as you wish as long as the environments and agents are supported.

To list ongoing runs you can run

```console
cogment run list_runs
```

To terminate a given run you can run

```console
RUN_ID=angry_gould cogment run terminate_run
```

Ongoing run identifiers to define `RUN_ID` can be retrieved by listing the ongoing runs with `cogment run list_runs`

#### Run monitoring

You can monitor ongoing run using [mlflow](https://mlflow.org). By default a local instance of mlflow is started by cogment-verse and is accessible at <http://localhost:3000>.

#### Human player

Some of the availabe run involve a human player, for example `benchmark_lander_hill` enables a human player to momentarily take control of the lunar lander to help the AI agents during the training process.

Then start the run

```console
RUN_PARAMS=benchmark_lander_hill cogment run start_run
```

Access the playing interface by navigating to <http://localhost:8080>

## Debug

### Resources monitoring

Cogment verse comes with [prometheus](https://prometheus.io), in [`/prometheus`](/prometheus), and [grafana](https://grafana.com), in [`/grafana`](/grafana), services to facilitate the monitoring of the cluster.

When running with the default `cogment run start`, the grafana dashboard can be accessed at <http://localhost:3001>.

### Profiling

Steps

- Add viztracer to python requirements.txt
- Modify docker-compose override
  - Add a mount for the profile results json/html file
  - Change the entrypoint of the service `viztracer --output_file /output/results.html script.py`
- Rebuild and run jobs
