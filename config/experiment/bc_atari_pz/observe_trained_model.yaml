# Notes
# Two random actors can play
# The BC actor can only play if it is the second actors.
# It returns an action value of 0 at every step when it is in 1st.

# Conclusion: It never moves when playing on the right, simply because it was trained with behavior cloning data playing from the left only.
# LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

# Result: it works.
