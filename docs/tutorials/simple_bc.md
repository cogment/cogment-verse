# Simple interactive behavioral cloning (BC)

## About

This is a interactive implementation of behavioral cloning (BC) that can be thought of as a simplified version of the DAGGER algorithm, intended to demonstrate the human-in-the-loop learning within Cogment Verse.

The overall architecture involves two actors

1. An AI agent uing a simple policy network whose action space is determined by the environment.
2. A human _teacher_ having the same action space extended by a single "take-no-action" `NO-OP` action.

The two actors cooperate during training by the following rule: if the teacher takes the `NO-OP` action, then we sample an action from the AI agent's policy, otherwise we use the action specified by the human. In this way, the human provides feedback to the agent in the form of implicit approval (by taking `NO-OP`) or by demonstration by overriding the agent's actions. By running trials in this way, we generate a sequence of pairs `(observation, perfomed_action)`. We train the AI agent by using the performed actions as target labels with a categorical cross-entropy loss.

We train the agent online as trials are running and each trial uses the latest snapshot of the agent's policy network. As the agent learns to mimic the human demonstrations, the human's task becomes easier as fewer interventions are required to correct the agent's behavior.

### Step 1 - Create a basic agent adapter

> Implementation for this step is available at [`/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/tutorial_1.py`](/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/tutorial_1.py)

In this step we create a dedicated **agent adapter** to implement behavior cloning. **Agent adapters** are a lightweight formalism to help implement agents and training algorithms together. 

In this case, it defines two Cogment implementations: an actor called `simple_bc` that is using the trained model, in this case a simple policy network, to take actions and a run called `simple_bc_training` that is orchestrating the training of the model.

- The agent adapter itself is defined in `/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/tutorial_1.py`. Because we intend on using **PyTorch** to define and train the policy network, we define the adapter inside the `torch_agents` folder (and as a consequence - as a part of the `torch_agents` service). That way it already has access to the needed dependencies. More details about the initial implementation will be found below.
- The adapter is registered with the service in `/torch_agents/main.py`
- The actor implementations `simple_bc` is added to the list of actor endpoints `COGMENT_VERSE_ACTOR_ENDPOINTS` in `/.env`. This enables Cogment to access the service(s) providing this implementation.
- Similarly, the run implementtion `simple_bc_training` is added to the list of run endpoints `COGMENT_VERSE_RUN_ENDPOINTS` in `/.env`.
- In order to configure the run, the `SimpleBCTrainingRunConfig` data structure (and the underlying `SimpleBCTrainingConfig`) are definined in `/data.proto`.
- Finally to be able to start runs, a few configurations are defined in `/run_params.yaml`, namely `simple_bc_lander` that uses the Lunar Lander environment, `simple_bc_cartpole` that uses Cartpole and `simple_bc_mountaincar` that uses MountainCar.

#### Implement the agent adapter

The `AgentAdapter` base class provides a simple way to implement new agents together with their corresponding training algorithms. A few methods must be implemented.

- `_create`: This instantiates the PyTorch model to be used by the actor implementation during trials and trained by the run implementation.
- `_save` and `_load`: These are used by Cogment Verse to serialize and deserialize models to and from the model registry to enable the distribution and storage of trained models.
- `_create_actor_implementations`: Returns the list of actor implementations to be registered, in our case only one named `simple_bc`. 
- `_create_run_implementations`: Returns the list of run implementations (e.g. training/evaluation regimens) to be registered, in our case only one named `simple_bc_training`. 

In this step, `_create`, `_save` and `_load` remains unimplemented.

#### First actor implementation, doing random action

In Cogment terminology, an **actor implementation** is a function that takes an actor session from a running trial and performs actions for each event in the actor's event loop for the trial, i.e. a funcion that performs an action for each observation received from the environment. In this first step the actor implementation does random actions.

#### First run implementation, starting trials with a human teacher

A **run implementation** consists of a function that launches trials and consumes the resulting data that is generated. Examples include training and evaluation.

The run implementation is paired with a **sample producer implementation** that is tasked with taking the raw event stream from a trial (e.g. `(state, action, reward)` tuples) and emits samples that can be directly consumed by the training/evaluation algorithm (e.g. `(state, action, reward, next_state)` transitions). In this first step the sample producer implementation does little, only logging a message each time a sample is received. [Step 2](#step-2-producing-samples) will go further.

In the first step, the run implementation is pretty minimal. It setup an experiment metrics tracker using MLFlow, then defines a function to create trial configuration and then starts a bunch a trials. No samples are retrieved yet because sample producer implementation doesn't produce any.

#### Running everything

Make sure you are using step 1 version of the adapter by editing the "default" export in `/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/__init__.py`.

First start the service:

```
./run.sh services_start
```
and web client in another terminal:
```
./run.sh web_client_start
```

Open `localhost:8080`.

Now we can launch a training run. There are three configurations provided:

- simple_bc_cartpole
- simple_bc_mountaincar
- simple_bc_lander

Start a training run as follows in the third terminal:

```
./run.sh client start simple_bc_lander
```

and open the web client to start interacting with the agent. At this step the agent will take random actions, as a human you can take over to play the game. In the console, the run implementation will log every time a sample is retrieved.

### Step 2 - Producing samples

In this second step, we properly define the **sample producer implementation**. 

At the top of the file, a few helpers are imported in order to convert actions and observations between the cogment verse format and PyTorch tensors.

In the event loop of the **sample producer implementation** those helpers are used to convert the observation, the agent action and the teacher action. If the teacher performed an action, this is the one used in the produced sample.

Samples are produced as tuples consisting: a flag identifying if the sample is a demonstration (coming from the teacher), the observation as a tensor, the action as a tensor.

Make sure you are using step 2 version of the adapter by editing the "default" export in `/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/__init__.py` and then launch a run as described in the previous step.

Nothing should change in the web browser but received samples should be logged. Notice that when the human takes over samples are logged with the demonstration flag to `True`.

### Step 3 - Defining a policy model

> Implementation for this step is available at [`/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/tutorial_3.py`](/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/tutorial_3.py)
>
> Changes from the previous step are surrounded by `############ TUTORIAL STEP 3 ############` comments

In this third step, we introduce an actual model: it is initialized in the **run implementation** and used in the **actor implementation**. To achieve that, `_create`, `_save`, and `_load` are fully implemented.

At the top of the file, we include the configuration structure for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and we define a named tuple structure for the model.

`_save` and `_load` are implemented using PyTorch's load and save function. 

Notice that we added named arguments to the `_create` functions. They are forwarded from the call to `self.create_and_publish_initial_version` that is added at the top of the run implementation.

The agent implementation uses `self.retrieve_version` to retrieve the model having the configured name and version. These are now specified as a part of the actor params in the run implementation. The version number is defined as `-1`, which means the latest available version. Also in the agent implementation, we use the action conversion helpers to build an `ActorAction` from the output of the policy network. 

Make sure you are using step 3 version of the adapter by editing the "default" export in `/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/__init__.py` and then launch a run as described in the previous step.

Nothing should change in the web browser the agent is still doing random actions, but it's now random actions computed by a neural network.

### Step 4 - Training

> Implementation for this step is available at [`/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/tutorial_4.py`](/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/tutorial_4.py)
>

This fourth step is about actually training the policy, aside from some import at the top, the changes are located in the run implementation and should be pretty straightforward for someone familiar with supervised learning with PyTorch.

One thing to notice is the way we deal with publishing new version of the model. This part of the code is only executed every 100 training steps, this is a tradeof between the reactivity of the training and limiting the amount of data exchanged over the network and the time spent serializing and deserializing models.

Make sure you are using step 4 version of the adapter by editing the "default" export in `/torch_agents/cogment_verse_torch_agents/simple_bc/__init__.py` and then launch a run as described in the previous step.

The agent is now learning, with a few demonstration it should start to clone the behavior of the human player.

You can view the logged metrics (e.g. training loss) by opening `localhost:3000`.
