# Overcooked Environment

You can use the overcooked environment integration with cogment-verse by installing a fork of the repository [overcooked_ai](git+https://github.com/wduguay-air/overcooked_ai.git)

In addition to the original installation instructions, run the following command:
```console
pip install overcooked_requirements.txt
```

The integration uses the `play` run implementation as defined in
`runs/play.py`

Example experiment configurations are provided at `config/experiment/overcooked`
